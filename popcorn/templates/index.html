h3(#how-it-works). How it works

Users of RPM-based Linux distributions (such as "openSUSE":http://opensuse.org or "Fedora":http://fedoraproject.org) provide weekly "anonymous":/faq#anonymity information about the packages they have installed. This is done by simply installing the *popcorn-client* package on their machines.

*popcorn-client* collects basic metadata about a participating user's system and all their installed packages. It also figures out when those packages were last used and splits them into four categories: _recent_, _old_, _voted_ or _nofiles_. Once a week it sends this data to the popcorn server (here). Read more about the popcorn-client "here":#.

The *Popcorn server* receives the data sent by *popcorn-client* and stores it in a database. We don't track user IPs or even the history of a system's installed packages over time. It then makes this data available to everyone through *charts* (like the ones above and on the various API documentation pages) and a "RESTful API":/api (for other services to use).


h3(#why). Why?

Linux distributions are built from open source packages. But there are a lot of them and people resources are often very limited. Figuring out which packages our users really use would help a lot with prioritising tasks. It's also good to know that someone uses that package you were up all night trying to build.

There are a lot of questions that Linux distributions ask themselves: from things as simple as figuring out what CPU architectures people are using to more specialised questions like:

* Should we bother to package gems as RPMs or is everyone installing them as gems anyway?
* Is anyone actually using python3 at this point?
* How long do people use an old distribution release for after we've declared it End of Life?


h3(#how-you-can-help). How you can help

The best way to help right now (and the easiest) if you're an RPM-based Linux distribution user is to "install popcorn-client":/download and then forget about it. It will send us the data we need to make your distribution better for you.

If you're a developer you might want to check out "the sources":http://github.com/opensuse/popcorn and hack something on the server. It's mostly python under an MIT License. Look for bugs in our "issue tracker"https://github.com/opensuse/popcorn/issues or think up new features. We're really open to contributions even if you're not so experienced.

If you want to develop a third party service, go ahead and look at the "API":/api.

If you have a question that you think popcorn's data might be able to answer and you can't find the answer by looking at all our crazy graphs, "contact us":/contact and we'll try to figure out an answer for you.
